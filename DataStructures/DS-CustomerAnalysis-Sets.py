
# Real-World Python Program: Store Customer Analysis Using Sets
# üéØ Scenario
# You‚Äôre working as a Data Analyst for a retail company with two stores ‚Äî Store A and Store B.
# You‚Äôve received customer purchase data (names or IDs).
# You need to perform analysis to understand customer patterns using set operations.
# üß† Business Questions
# Which customers purchased from both stores?
# Which customers are exclusive to Store A?
# Which customers are exclusive to Store B?
# What is the total unique customer base?
# Which customers purchased from either store but not both?

# ‚ÄúCan you give a real-life example where you‚Äôd use sets?‚Äù
# ‚ÄúIn one of my practice projects, I used Python sets to analyze retail customer data ‚Äî finding unique customers, overlapping customers between stores, and exclusive ones. 
# It was similar to using DISTINCT and JOIN concepts in SQL, but handled efficiently using Python sets.‚Äù
